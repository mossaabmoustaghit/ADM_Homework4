# ADM_Homework4

We implemented a simplified version of Shazam dealing with hashing algorithms.
Then we will play with a dataset gathering songs from the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference. We will focus on the track information, features (extracted with librosa library from Python) and audio variables provided by Echonest (now Spotify).

## Content Description
* **main.ipynb**: is a Jupyter notebook where we show the solution to the whole homework (graphs, tables and comments).
* **link.txt**: is a file containing the link of the main directly in *Jupyter Notebook Viewer*, for a clearer reading(especially for writing in Latex).
